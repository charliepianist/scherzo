## Scherzo

A chrome privacy extension. Currently the files are pretty much entirely filler, but the general structure should not change too much in the future.

### Compiling and Running
#### Compiling
To compile, just run [dev-util/compile.sh](dev-util/compile.sh) (e.g. with ```bash dev-util/compile.sh```), and the compiled JavaScript files will be put in [bin/js](bin/js).

#### Running
To run the extension, go to Extensions and enable developer mode, then click on "Load unpacked". The extension should now be ready to test.

### Todos
- Set up a testing environment! Probably using Closure + JSUnit.
